# üö¶ Traffic Sign Recognition (GTSRB)  

This project focuses on recognizing German traffic signs using deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
The goal is to classify traffic signs into their correct categories and extend the model to real-time video detection with bounding boxes and labels.

## üìå Project Overview  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded images from CSV paths, resized to 32√ó32, normalized pixel values, and one-hot encoded labels.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied random rotations, shifts, and zoom transformations to improve model generalization.  
- **Model Training**: Built a custom CNN with convolution, pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers to classify signs.  
- **Evaluation**: Measured accuracy and loss during training, evaluated on test data, and visualized confusion matrix.  
- **Video Testing**: Implemented OpenCV pipeline to detect red-bordered signs, classify them, and overlay bounding boxes with predictions.
